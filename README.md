makefiles
=========

makefiles is a set of makefiles I use whenever I might need to build a small project.

Currently, this only include a C makefile until I write/need others.


Usage
-----

Copy `makefile` and `config.mk` for the desired language into your project and edit `config.mk` to match your needs.
